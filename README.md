iTunes Backup File Extractor
===========
Simple app that extract all the media files (Images, Videos, Music...) contained in your iTunes backup.


Description
---- 
iTunes stores a copy of all your iDevice files in a backup folder.
Those files can't be view directly because iTunes encrypts the filenames using SHA-1.

The purpose of this application is to retrieve the right extension, rename the files and copy them in the output folder.


Usage
=====
Compile application using Visual Studio.

Just run the app, select your iTunes backup folder, your output folder, select the filetypes you want to extract and click on "Go!" to start the extraction.

iTunes backup folder example: 
- Windows 7 : "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\YOUR_BACKUP_FOLDER"

- Windows XP : "C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\YOUR_BACKUP_FOLDER"
